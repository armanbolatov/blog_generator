My name is Nursultan, and I am originally from Kazakhstan. I am currently a student at Nazarbayev University, where I am studying environmental science. I have always been interested in the environment and how we can help preserve it for future generations. My studies at Nazarbayev University have provided me with the knowledge and skills I need to make a difference.

I have learned about the importance of environmental conservation and the ways in which we can protect our planet. I have also gained valuable research and analytical skills that I can use to help solve environmental problems. My studies have also helped me to understand the social and economic impacts of environmental issues.

I would encourage anyone who is interested in environmental science to consider studying at Nazarbayev University. The university offers a unique opportunity to learn about environmental science in a global context. The faculty are experts in their field, and the curriculum is designed to give students a comprehensive understanding of the environment and the issues it faces.

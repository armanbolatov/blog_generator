My name is Alina and I am originally from Kazakhstan. I am currently a student at Nazarbayev University, studying International Relations. I decided to study at Nazarbayev University because it is one of the best universities in Kazakhstan and it has a great reputation. The benefits of studying at Nazarbayev University include the world-class facilities and the opportunity to meet people from all over the world. My experience studying at Nazarbayev University has been great so far and I would definitely recommend it to others.
